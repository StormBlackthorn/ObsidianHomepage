My Obsidian Homepage Loadout

This is entirely made with only markdown and css!

This dashboard is made with [MCL Multi Column](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout)

Heavily inspired by [this design](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mk3vas/how_to_achieve_this_layout_made_some_progress_but/).
I'll admit that the syntax for the dashboard is... not the greatest(5 layered callouts!?). But I really find this to be pretty, accessible, and easily configurable :)

## Plugins used in this dashboard:
  -  Banner, clock, and icon: [Simple Banner](https://github.com/eatcodeplay/obsidian-simple-banner)
  -  Search Bar: [Home Tab](https://github.com/olrenso/obsidian-home-tab)

#### Optional Plugins(But highly recommended): 
  - Open home page on startup: [Homepage](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage)
  - Getting statistics & recently opened files: [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
  - Tabs(on Todo and Links card): [Tabs](https://github.com/xhuajin/obsidian-tabs)
  - Making sure the width of the dashboard is right: [Editor Width Slider](https://github.com/MugishoMp/obsidian-editor-width-slider)
    - *I find that the default width is a bit too small for a dashboard
